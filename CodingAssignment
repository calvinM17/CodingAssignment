//⦁	Create an array called ages that contains the following values: 3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93.
⦁	Programmatically subtract the value of the first element in the array from the value in the last element of the array (do not use numbers to reference the last element, find it programmatically, ages[7] – ages[0] is not allowed). Print the result to the console.

var ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93];
var last = ages[ages.length - 1]
var first = ages[ages.length - ages.length]
var subtract = last - first
console.log(subtract); 

//⦁	Add a new age to your array and repeat the step above to ensure it is dynamic (works for arrays of different lengths).

var ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93];
ages.push(100);
var last = ages[ages.length - 1]
var first = ages[ages.length - ages.length]
var subtract = last - first
console.log(subtract); 

// ⦁	Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average age. Print the result to the console

var ages = [3, 9, 23, 64, 2, 8, 28, 93];
ages.push(37);
var sum = 0,
 avg = 0.0
for (var i = 0; i < ages.length; i++) {
 sum = sum + ages[i]
}
avg = sum / ages.length
console.log('Average age is: ' + avg);

// ⦁	Create an array called names that contains the following values: ‘Sam’, ‘Tommy’, ‘Tim’, ‘Sally’, ‘Buck’, ‘Bob’.
⦁	Use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the average number of letters per name. Print the result to the console.
